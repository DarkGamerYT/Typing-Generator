End midlands are larger areas that transition you from the center to the outer edges of the End.\nThey contain Shulkers, Endermen, End gateway portals, and End cities.\nEnd gateway portals are commonly found at the outermost edge of the void.\nYou usually find End barrens toward the edges of the main areas or land in the End."
