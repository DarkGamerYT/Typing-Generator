/**
 * @beta
 * A BlockLocationIterator returns the next block location of the block volume across which it is iterating.
 * The BlockLocationIterator is used to abstract the shape of the block volume it was fetched from (so it can represent
 * all the block locations that make up rectangles, cubes, spheres, lines and complex shapes).
 * Each iteration pass returns the next valid block location in the parent shape.
 * Unless otherwise specified by the parent shape - the BlockLocationIterator will iterate over a 3D space in the
 * order of increasing X, followed by increasing Z followed by increasing Y.
 * (Effectively stepping across the XZ plane, and when all the locations in that plane are exhausted, increasing the Y coordinate to the next XZ slice)
