    "description": "A simulated player can be used within GameTests to represent how a player moves throughout the world and to support testing of how entities and the environment will react to a player.\nThis type derives much of its structure and methods from the {@link minecraftserver.Player} type.\nNote that many types of events that may be available for entities more broadly, such as item use events, may not fire in the same capacity for simulated players."
