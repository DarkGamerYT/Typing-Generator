    "description": "Editor Extensions are the basis for all player specific, editor specific functionality within the game.\nAlmost all editor functionality is exported and available within the context of an {@link ExtensionContext}\nWhen the script manager initializes during level loading, the scripts are loaded from the behavior packs and executed.\nAs part of the global execution context, the scripts are free to register any number of extensions.\nAn Editor Extension is defined a name, an activation function and a shutdown function.\n\nIt is not recommended to directly use this function as the contract is not guaranteed to be stable,\ninstead prefer {@link registerEditorExtension} as it provides additional functionality and a stable contract."
